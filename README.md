# Klue

Klue is a website to help you remember the kanji. It's based off of the 6th edition of [Remembering the Kanji by James W. Heisig](https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921).

Fundamentally, Klue is just a website that turns whatever character set you give it into flashcards. It is your job to fill in the information for each character you learn along the way.

## Getting Started

The website will first ask you for a character set. You can find the ordered character set for Remembering the Kanji [here](https://gist.github.com/llGaetanll/b7ce3ef325e6c6da0f3e45d66fd5d7c9).

1. Copy the content of the gist into a json file
2. Upload the file to the website

## Keyboard Shortcuts

To make it as fast as possible to input data about the kanji, you can use the following shortcuts

- `right` move to the next kanji
- `left` (only in edit mode) go back to the previous kanji
- `space` toggle the definition and notes associated with the kanji
- `e` Enter edit mode
- `esc` Exit edit mode
